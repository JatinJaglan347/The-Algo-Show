# The Algo Show

**The Algo Show** is an interactive visualization tool designed to help users understand and learn how popular sorting algorithms work. By visually representing the sorting process step-by-step, this project makes complex concepts easier to grasp. Additionally, it provides code implementations of each algorithm in multiple programming languages, including Java, C++, JavaScript, Python, and C.

Built using modern web technologies:
- **React** for building the UI.
- **Vite** for a fast development environment.
- **TailwindCSS** for elegant and responsive styling.
